## Homework 1

Design, code, and run a simulation exploring the sensitivity of IV estimates and standard confidence intervals to the strength of the instrument. Use sample size
n = 100 observations per dataset.

Each simulation runs 1,000 replications. In each simulation, the instrument strength has different values so we can see how small it must be to start affecting the properties of the IV estimator and CIs.
